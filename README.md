Trying to enable the player's sprite to divide  
    using right mouse  
Many math functions need improvement  
The first ball remains pink  
    but the others are black

## And things to be done:  
network  
room scene for online play  
choose play mode (free or team etc.)  
control by keyboard  
other players' sprite  
a loading scene  
a score lable  
etc.
